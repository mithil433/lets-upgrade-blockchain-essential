This technology aims to avoid the hacks and avoids to loose the data.Blockchain main advantages are huge security,verifiable,data transparency and decentralised.

 

Q2)what is the core problem blockchain trying to solve?

A) The three main things are 1)verifiabilty

2)security

3)authenticity

 

Q3) What are the few features that blockchain will give you ?

A)

1)verifiable

2)unchangeable

3)immutable

4)tamper_proof

 

Q4)What all things does blockchain contains ?

A)1)block number

2)transaction records

3)previous block signature

4)mining key

 

Q5)How is verifiability of blockchain is been attained ?

a)This is main advantage of blockchain in terms of verfiability.

The hash key(fingureprint) of the transaction records(data) will automatically gets changed when the transaction record(data) gets changed.Thus,this way we can checkthe verifiability
